“We use Dagster Cloud to orchestrate and schedule our data pipelines. For this hackathon, I built a data hydration workflow in Dagster, deployed it to the cloud, and today I’ll show you how the assets can be visualized and materialized in the UI.”


“From code to cloud: orchestrating data workflows with Dagster.”

“Our data platform engineering team leverages Dagster Cloud as the orchestration and scheduling layer for our data pipelines.
As part of the hackathon, I built a data hydration workflow using Dagster, defined assets, and then deployed the automation into Dagster Cloud.
In this demo, I’ll show how those assets appear in the Dagster UI and walk through the process of materializing them.”
